                            <h1>Lean canvas</h1>
                            The Lean Canvas is a lean startup adaptation of the
                            Business Model Canvas. The lean canvas focuses on
                            addressing broad customer problems and solutions and
                            delivering them to customer segments through a unique
                            value proposition. You can read more about it on
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">Wikipedia</a>
                            or <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a>.

                            <h3>The whole idea</h3>
                            The whole idea of all that is to use simple tool
                            online without spending money on buying existing
                            solutions or printing lean canvas every time you
                            decide to make changes.

                            <h3>How it works</h3>
                            You must have cookies enabled to save template that
                            you are working on locally. I am still looking for
                            saving them on server somewhere.
                            <div class="ui divider"></div>
                            The canvas is represented as a set of columns. Each
                            column consists of one or two directories, which has
                            got its own name and description. Each directory is
                            a folder for notes that you may create, and is
                            supposed to organise them into different categories,
                            such <b>problems</b>, <b>solutions</b> and etc.
                            You can add note to a directory with
                            <span class="ui label">+ note</span>
                            <div class="ui divider"></div>
                            Note can be edited using <span class="ui label">Edit</span>
                            or deleted using <span class="ui label">Delete</span>
                            The new thing in this version is tags, so now you can
                            assign multiple tags to the note using dropdown menu,
                            instead of only one previously.
                            <div class="ui divider"></div>
                            Create a tag with <span class="ui label">+ tag</span>
                            button, select colour by clicking on the left square
                            and type tag's name in.
                            You cannot create tags from within editor (but it is
                            something to think about).
                            And there is no drag-n-drop feature yet.

                            <h3>Menu controls</h3>
                            You can visit github page and load previous version
                            using controls on left side.
                            <span class="ui label">New layout</span> allows you
                            to load new clear template. <span class="ui label">Save</span>
                            saves template locally using cookies, <span class="ui label">Load</span>
                            loads stored template. When you go to the website, it
                            will try loading stored template anyway.
                            <span class="ui label">Save as Gist</span> and
                            <span class="ui label">Load Gist</span> save and load
                            gist from Github respectivelly. It is recommended not
                            only save your work locally, but also save it as Gist,
                            thus later you can paste link and load template again.

                            <h3>Compatibility with older version</h3>
                            New lean canvas can load templates that were created
                            using v.1.0.2, though tags (note colours) will not
                            be imported.
