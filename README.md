### Lean canvas
Lean canvas project to build web interface for one page business model.
Very simple interface. Uses cookies to store files (sort of temporary, while you are working on one canvas) and github gists to store files permanently on Github.

To have a look: http://sadikovi.github.io/leancanvas/
